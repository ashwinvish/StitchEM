function varargout = minaabb(X, Y)
%MINAABB Computes the vertices of the minimum axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of a set of points.
% Returns a set of points, the closed polygonal chain, which are the
% vertices of the minimum area axis aligned bounding box (AABB) around
% the given points.
%
% Usage:
%   V = minaabb(P)
%   V = minaabb(X, Y)
%   [Vx, Vy] = minaabb(P)
%   [Vx, Vy] = minaabb(X, Y)
%
% Args:
%   P is a vector of M points and must be a Mx2 or 2xM matrix.
%       Note: If P is a 2x2 matrix, it is assumed to be a vertical vector,
%       i.e, of the form: P = [x1, y1; x2, y2].
%   Alternatively, you can specify the points in two vectors:
%   [X, Y] must be Mx1 or 1xM coordinate vectors of the same length.
%
% Returns (default):
%   V is a 5x2 matrix of the vertices of the minimum AABB.
%   If there are two output targets:
%   [Vx, Vy] are 5x1 column vectors of the x and y components of V.
%   Notes:
%       - The points in V form a closed polygonal chain.
%           => Closed implies that the last point is the same as the first.
%       - The points are the vertices of the minimum AABB (a rectangle).
%       - The points are are specified counter-clockwise starting at the
%         bottom-left vertex.
%
% Misc. Notes:
%   - This is also known as the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR).
%   - This is NOT the minimum bounding box that contains the points!
%   Smaller bounding boxes can likely be found by computing arbitrarily
%   oriented minimum boxes (OMMBs). These can be further minimized by
%   removing the constraint that the boxes be rectangles. Other convex
%   quadrangles may be even smaller bounding boxes.
