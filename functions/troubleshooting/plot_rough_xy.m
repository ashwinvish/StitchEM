function plot_rough_xy(sec)
%PLOT_ROUGH_XY Plots the tiles of a section using its rough XY alignment. Colors tiles that were grid aligned differently.
% Usage:
%   plot_rough_xy(sec)

% Parameters
PatchSpec_grid = 'r0.1';
PatchSpec_registered = 'g0.1';

% Check for alignment
assert(isfield(sec.alignments, 'rough_xy'), 'Section must have a rough XY alignment.')

% Get bounding boxes
bounding_boxes = sec_bb(sec, 'rough_xy');

% Draw tiles
figure, hold on
for tile = 1:sec.num_tiles
    if any(sec.alignments.rough_xy.meta.grid_aligned == tile)
        draw_poly(bounding_boxes{tile}, PatchSpec_grid)
    else
        draw_poly(bounding_boxes{tile}, PatchSpec_registered)
    end
end
