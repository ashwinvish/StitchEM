% Calculate xy_match stats
%
% Inputs:
%   sec: the section with xy matches & alignment
%
% Outputs:
%   stats: table of transformed matches and their displacements
%
% There should be a tight distribution between points in the same overlap.
% If points do not closely clump in the same overlap, then there is likely
% a poor match that should be investigated.
